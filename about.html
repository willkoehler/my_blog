        I build custom web applications for small businesses and startups. I take projects from concept
        to final deliverable, often continuing with hosting, long-term maintenance, and updates.
      </p>

      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Turning business requirements into a clean simple web application</li>
        <li>Ruby + Rails</li>
        <li>HTML, CSS / SCSS</li>
        <li>Front-end Javascript</li>
        <li>AWS infrastructure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The solutions I deliver to my clients improve daily workflow, track key business metrics, and make
        companies more efficient. These applications commonly return the initial investment in under
        a year via revenue growth and cost savings and continue to generate wealth for many years
        after that.

      <h2>Pictures</h2>
      <p>
        The pictures in this blog are scenes from my neighborhood, city, and surrounding
        countryside. I like living in Columbus, OH. It's the best city no one
        knows about.
