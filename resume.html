      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a senior-level developer and system architect. I specialize in helping companies focus a
        collection of business needs into a clean, simple software solution. I take projects from concept
        to final deliverable, often continuing with long-term maintenance and updates. I constantly
        push to simplify and remove unnecessary decisions and distractions from the user. The resulting
        applications improve daily workflow, track key business metrics, and make companies more efficient.
        These applications commonly return the initial investment in under a year via revenue growth
        and cost savings and continue to generate wealth for many years after that.
      </p>

      <h1>Consulting Work</h1>

      <div class='time_span'>
        <h2>
          Web Applications
          <div class='dates'>2005 - present</div>
          <div class='tools'>
            Ruby + Rails &bull; PHP &bull; JavaScript &bull; jQuery &bull; MySQL &bull; HTML/CSS &bull;
            AWS
          </div>
        </h2>
        <div class='details'>
          <p>
            My preferred stack is Ruby on Rails with a lightweight JavaScript front end. The bulk of the
            application logic and views are in the Rails application with just enough front-end code
            to make the user experience fluid and seamless. My applications run on AWS infrastructure,
            managed by AWS OpsWorks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I maintain several legacy apps built with PHP and ExtJS. While no longer cutting edge, these
            apps have been running flawlessly for over 10 years and still deliver important business
            value.
          </p>

          <h3>Infoquest, Ltd</h3>
          <p>
            Developed the Investigation Management System, a tool that tracks workers compensation fraud
            investigations. The system handles every step of an investigation from initial request to
            monitoring progress to client communications to reporting and invoicing. Investigators can
            upload surveillance videos and enter surveillance notes from their iPads in the field, saving
            them significant time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key challenge:</b> Encoding and streaming video for playback on a variety of platforms
            including mobile and flash-based players. Surveillance notes can be linked with the
            surveillance video so clients can see video clips associated with each surveillance note.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Impact:</b> The IMS helped Infoquest acquire new clients and grow annual revenue from
            $3M to $4M (2013 to 2016). Key clients, like Toyota and Nationwide, cite the efficiency
            of using the IMS as a primary reason for working with Infoquest. In addition, by simplifying
            management and investigation work, the IMS saves Infoquest $200k/year in overhead and
            employee costs.
          </p>

          <h3>Orion America Technologies, LLC</h3>
          <p>
            Drawing on Orion AT's expertise in government contract management, I created OMIS, a tool
            to track projects at FAA-funded research centers. The resulting application is getting
            attention at all levels of the FAA as an example of the right way to track FAA-sponsored
            research.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key challenge:</b> Building a system where a wide range of people, from Program Managers,
            to Principal Investigators, to Tech Monitors, to Fiscal Admins, to Contract Admins, each
            feel the system is designed specifically around their needs and makes their job easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Impact:</b> Six months after launch, the OMIS is generating $150k/yr in revenue with
            expected growth to $200k/yr in 2018. In turn, by improving accuracy and reducing duplication
            of effort, the OMIS is saving the FAA $360k/yr in administrative oversight costs, expected to
            grow to $560k/yr in 2018.
          </p>

          <h3>Pharmacy Systems, Inc</h3>
          <p>
            I've worked with Pharmacy Systems for over 15 years building a wide range of tools to
            help them manage hospital pharmacies, hospital supply chains, and hospital rehab units.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key challenge:</b> Distilling Pharmacy Systems' business data into a set of key
            metrics that clearly shows the value they are providing to their customers.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Impact:</b> The Contract Management System has generated $100k/yr in revenue since
            it's launch in 2012.
          </p>

          <h3>Chase Bank</h3>
          <p>
            Built a tool with Microsoft Access and ASP that helped Chase Bank to identify
            and document relationships between their private banking customers. I analyzed
            the resulting data with MS SQL Server.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Impact:</b> Helped private banking agents identify the full value of banking
            relationships so they could optimize service for customers that were generating
            the most value for the bank.
          </p>
          <h3>Kal Kan - Mars Petcare</h3>
          <p>
            Built several tools with Microsoft Access and Visual Basic. The Hold System
            tracks inventory that was set aside (on hold) due to production problems. The
            Conformance System tracks production line output and conformance to product
            standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Impact:</b> Helped Kal Kan improve production efficiency by identifying
            trends in production line conformance. Reduced waste by getting on hold inventory
            back into production quickly, before it needed to be discarded.

          </p>

            <b>Key challenge:</b> Developed a fault-tolerant communications protocol that used

          <h3>STAR Dynamics Corporation</h3>
          <p>
            Worked on a team developing a high resolution tracking radar. The radar had a phased

            a few inches of resolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key challenges:</b> Designed an ultra low-latency communication protocol to interface
            between the target acquisition system and the tracking system. Designed a non-blocking,
