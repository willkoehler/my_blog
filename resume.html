      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>
        I'm a senior-level developer and system architect. I specialize in helping companies focus a
        collection of business needs into a clean, simple software solution. I take projects from concept
        to final deliverable, often continuing with long-term maintenance and updates.
      </p>
      <p> I constantly push to simplify and remove unnecessary decisions and distractions from the user.
        The resulting applications improve daily workflow, track key business metrics, and make companies
        more efficient. These applications commonly return the initial investment in under a year via
        revenue growth and cost savings and continue to generate wealth for many years after that.
      </p>

          <p>
            My preferred stack is Ruby on Rails with a lightweight JavaScript front end. The bulk of the
            application logic and views are in the Rails application with just enough front-end code
            to make the user experience fluid and seamless. My applications run on AWS infrastructure,
            managed by AWS OpsWorks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I maintain several legacy apps built with PHP and ExtJS. While no longer cutting edge, these
            apps have been running flawlessly for over 10 years and still deliver important business
            value.
          </p>

          <h3>Client Overview</h3>

          <p>
            Many of my clients have been with me for 10+ years and return year after year to add
            enhancements to existing products, or to start new projects.

            Infoquest, Ltd
          </h3>
          <p>
            Developed the <b>Investigation Management System</b>, a tool that tracks workers compensation fraud
            investigations. The system is a vital part of <a href='http://infoquestinv.com' target='_blank'>Infoquest's</a>
            business and handles every step of an investigation from initial request to monitoring progress to
            client communications to reporting and invoicing. Investigators can upload surveillance videos and
            enter surveillance notes from their iPads in the field, saving them significant time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key challenge:</b> Encoding and streaming video for playback on a variety of platforms
            including mobile and flash-based players.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Impact:</b> The IMS helped Infoquest acquire new clients and grow annual revenue from
            $3M to $4M (2013 to 2016). Key clients, like Toyota and Nationwide, cite the efficiency
            of using the IMS as a primary reason for working with Infoquest. In addition, by simplifying
            management and investigation work, the IMS saves Infoquest $200k/year in overhead and
            employee costs.

          <p>
            Drawing on <a href='http://www.orionat.com' target='_blank'>Orion AT's</a> expertise in government contract management,
            I created OMIS, a tool to track projects at FAA-funded research centers. The resulting application
            is getting attention at all levels of the FAA as an example of the right way to track FAA-sponsored
            research.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Key challenge:</b> Building a system where a wide range of people, from Program Managers,
            to Principal Investigators, to Tech Monitors, to Fiscal Admins, to Contract Admins, each
            feel the system is designed specifically around their needs and makes their job easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Impact:</b> Six months after launch, the OMIS generated $150k/yr in revenue. In turn,
            by improving accuracy and reducing duplication of effort, the OMIS saved the FAA $360k/yr
            in administrative oversight costs.
